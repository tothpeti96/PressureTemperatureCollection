# PressureTemperatureCollection
With the help of the arduino script you can read data arriving from a 4-20 mA standrad amplifier which has linear characteristic. This program was initially made to read Tempreture and Pressure values of a high pressure laboratory vessel but with establishing a proper calibration curve any digital data arriving from such ampifier can be processed. The repository also contains a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to provide an easy use to any user. The collected data are automatically saved to an Excel spreadsheet for later data visualization or manipulation.
